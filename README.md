        <summary>Electronic Watch</summary>
        <p>
          Please, proceed to <code>ElectronicWatch</code> class.
          The program must print an electronic watch screen output for a given value of seconds since midnight.<br>
          Input value is given via <code>System.in</code>.
          Output value must be printed to <code>System.out</code>.<br>
          It is guaranteed, that input number is non-negative.<br>
          Output format is <code>h:mm:ss</code> (possible values: [0:00:00; 23:59:59]).<br>
          <i>Extra challenge</i>: try to solve the task without using <code>if</code> statements or cycles.

        <summary>Meet an Agent</summary>
        <p>Please, proceed to <code>MeetAnAgent</code> class and write a program that:<br>
          <ul>
            <li>asks for an input number,</li><br>
            <li>if the input equals to the secret password number, prints <I>"Hello, Agent"</i>,</li><br>
            <li>otherwise, prints <I>"Access denied"</i>.</li><br>
          </ul>
          Secret password is stored in <code>final static int PASSWORD</code>.<br>
          It is guaranteed that the input is not null.</p>

        <summary>Meet Strangers</summary>
        <p>Please, proceed to <code>HelloStrangers</code> class and write a program that:<br>
          <ul>
          <li>asks for a number - amount of strangers to meet,</li><br>
          <li>then reads stranger names line by line,</li><br>
          <li>and, finally, prints line by line <I>"Hello, stranger name"</i> for each stranger.</li><br>
          </ul>
          It is guaranteed that the input is not null. It is guaranteed that the input of strangers count is int number.<br>
          Consider special cases:<br>
          <ul>
          <li>If strangers count is zero, then program must print <I>"Oh, it looks like there is no one here"</i>.</li><br>
          <li>If strangers count is negative, then program must print <I>"Seriously? Why so negative?"</i>.</li><br>

          Please, proceed to <code>Snail</code> class and write a program that prints number of days for the snail to reach the top of the tree.<br>
          Program reads <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>h</code> line by line. Input values are guaranteed to be positive integers.<br>
          If the snail cannot reach the top of the tree, print the message <I>Impossible</i>.<br></p>

          Please, proceed to <code>GoDutch</code> class and write a program that reads a bill total amount and a number of friends, and then prints part to pay.<br>
          Consider some details:<br>
          <ul>
          <li>Program must read data from <code>System.in</code></li><br>
          <li>Bill total amount cannot be negative. If input value is negative, the program stops, printing: <I>Bill total amount cannot be negative</i></li><br>
          <li>Number of friends cannot be negative or zero. If input value is, then the program stops, printing: <I>Number of friends cannot be negative or zero</i></li><br>
          <li>Bill total amount, number of friends and part to pay are integers</li><br>
          </ul></p>

        <summary>Max Value In Sequence</summary>
        <p>Please, proceed to <code>FindMaxInSeq</code> and write a program that reads a sequence of integer values from standard output and finds the maximum value. You must place your solution into the <code>max</code> method to pass tests.<br>
          Details:
          <ul>
          <li>You must read sequence values until the next one is <code>0</code>. Zero value means end of the input sequence.</li><br>
          <li>The sequence is guaranteed to contain at least one value.</li><br>
